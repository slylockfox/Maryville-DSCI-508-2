       "'films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they\\'re about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there\\'s never really been a comic book like from hell before . \\nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid \\'80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \\nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \\nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \\nin other words , don\\'t dismiss this film because of its source . \\nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell\\'s directors , albert and allen hughes . \\ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that\\'s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \\nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london\\'s east end . \\nit\\'s a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \\nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \\nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \\nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn\\'t so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can\\'t stomach . \\ni don\\'t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won\\'t go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \\nin the comic , they don\\'t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \\nit\\'s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \\nand from hell\\'s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \\ndon\\'t worry - it\\'ll all make sense when you see it . \\nnow onto from hell\\'s appearance : it\\'s certainly dark and bleak enough , and it\\'s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \\nthe print i saw wasn\\'t completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don\\'t say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \\noscar winner martin childs\\' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \\neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \\nians holm ( joe gould\\'s secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \\ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn\\'t half bad . \\nthe film , however , is all good . \\n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \\n'"
